# App Pokedex

A Flutter project.

## Description

This project was the first that I put more work in it. I decide to to a symple app but I wanted to use everything that I already has learned so far. The idea was to replicade a Pokedex, you have the main page where is all Pokemons and when you click in one Pokemon you go to another page where you have all the details about that pokemon. I was praticing dependency injection and state management and responsiveness. I used MobX to do all the state management part, GetIt to do the dependency injection and used MediaQuerry for the responsiveness. Was my first contact with animations too and I kind liked the way that animations can make your app more alive.
